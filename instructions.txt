Resona Project - Installation Guide

==========================================
üìå Prerequisites
==========================================
Before setting up the project, ensure you have:
- Python 3.9 installed (Essentia works best with this version).
- Git installed to clone the repository.
- FFmpeg installed for audio processing.

==========================================
üì• Step 1: Clone the Repository
==========================================
1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Run the following commands:
   
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/resona.git
   cd resona

==========================================
üõ† Step 2: Set Up a Virtual Environment
==========================================
To avoid conflicts with system packages, create a virtual environment:

- For Mac/Linux:
  
  python3 -m venv resona_env
  source resona_env/bin/activate

- For Windows (Command Prompt):

  python -m venv resona_env
  resona_env\Scripts\activate

==========================================
üì¶ Step 3: Install Dependencies
==========================================
Run the following command to install all required packages:

  pip install -r requirements.txt

==========================================
üéµ Step 4: Install FFmpeg
==========================================
FFmpeg is required for audio conversion. Install it based on your OS:

- Mac (Homebrew):

  brew install ffmpeg

- Ubuntu:

  sudo apt install ffmpeg

- Windows (Chocolatey):

  choco install ffmpeg

==========================================
‚úÖ Step 5: Verify Installation
==========================================
Test if everything is installed correctly by running:

  python -c "import essentia.standard as es; print('Essentia is working!')"

If you see "Essentia is working!", the setup was successful.

==========================================
üöÄ Step 6: Run the Feature Extraction Script
==========================================
Once everything is set up, extract features for a song by running:

  python audio_extraction/test.py

Make sure the song file is placed in the "audio_extraction/" directory before running the script.

==========================================
‚ùì Troubleshooting
==========================================

1. **Essentia Installation Issues**
   - If you get an import error for Essentia, try reinstalling it:

     pip uninstall essentia
     pip install essentia==2.1b6.dev1177

   - If NumPy version errors appear, install an older version:

     pip install "numpy<2"

2. **FFmpeg Not Found**
   - Run `ffmpeg -version` to check if it's installed.
   - If not, install it using the OS-specific commands above.

==========================================
